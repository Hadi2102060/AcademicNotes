## Answer: 

## What is a Trial Balance? <br>

A trial balance is a list of all the accounts in a business, showing their balances at a specific point in time. It helps check if total debits (money going out) equal total credits (money coming in), ensuring the accounts are balanced.

## Why is a Trial Balance Prepared? <br>

**Check for Errors**: It helps spot mistakes in the accounting records.<br>

**Ensure Balance**: Confirms that the total debits and credits are equal.<br>

**Prepare Financial Statements**: It's used as a base to create the final financial reports (like the income statement and balance sheet).

# Statements Included in a Financial Statement:

**Income Statement (Profit & Loss Statement)**: Shows how much money the business made (revenue) and spent (expenses) over a specific period, and whether it had a profit or loss.

# "share holders of a public limited company are external users  of Accounting information", Do you agree? why?   in easy word and short?

## Answer: 
es, I agree.

Why?
Shareholders of a public limited company are considered external users of accounting information because:

They are not involved in the day-to-day operations of the business.
They need accounting information to make decisions about buying, holding, or selling shares.
They use financial reports to check the company’s performance and financial health, but they don’t directly control the company’s finances.<br>

# Discuss the limitation of trial balance ? in easy word and short?

## Answer: <br>

## Limitations of a Trial Balance:

**Doesn’t Catch All Errors**: It won’t spot mistakes like recording an incorrect amount or posting to the wrong account, as long as debits and credits still match.

**Won’t Detect Omissions**: If a transaction is completely left out of the books, the trial balance will still balance.

**No Guarantee of Accuracy**: A balanced trial balance doesn’t mean all entries are correct; it only shows that debits and credits are equal.

**Fraud May Go Unnoticed**: If someone intentionally manipulates both debit and credit entries, the trial balance can still look correct.

## Answer: <br>

## What is an Accounting Information System (AIS)?
An Accounting Information System (AIS) is a system used to collect, store, and process financial data and generate reports for decision-making. It helps businesses manage their accounting tasks more efficiently.

Does Accounting Information Only Apply Manually?
No, I don’t agree. Accounting information systems can be both manual (handwritten) or computerized (software-based).

## Example:


**Manual System**: A small business owner records sales and expenses in a notebook or ledger by hand.
Computerized System: Most companies today use accounting software like QuickBooks or SAP to automatically track transactions, generate reports, and reduce errors.
