# When Maintenances are required?

## Answer: <br>

Software maintenance means making changes and updates to a program after it’s finished. Here are some easy reasons why software needs changes:

**Market Changes** – Sometimes, new rules or laws are made, like new tax rules, and the software has to change to follow these rules.

**Customer Requests** – Over time, customers might want the software to have new features or do more things, so updates are needed.

**Technology Changes** – If the computers or operating systems that run the software change, the program needs updates to keep working properly.

**Company Changes** – If a company gets bigger, smaller, or starts doing new kinds of work, the software may need changes to fit the company’s new needs.


# Types of Maintenance 



In the life of a software program, different kinds of care are needed depending on the problem. Sometimes, it's a quick fix, like solving a small mistake a user finds. Other times, it might be a bigger update. Here are some simple types of maintenance:

**Corrective Maintenance** – This is when changes are made to fix problems or errors. These problems are found by users or noticed when something isn't working right.

**Adaptive Maintenance** – This happens when updates are made to help the software work well with new technology or changes in business. It’s like upgrading the program to keep it working with the latest tools.

**Perfective Maintenance** – These updates are done to make the software better over time. This could mean adding new features, making it faster, or making it more helpful for users.

**Preventive Maintenance** – This is done to stop future problems before they happen. Even if the software is working fine now, updates are made to avoid bigger problems later on.<br>

# Cost of Maintenance 

Reports suggest that the cost of maintenance is high. A study on estimating software maintenance found that the cost of maintenance is as high as 67% of the cost of entire  software process cycle.<br>

On an average, the cost of software maintenance is more than 50% of all SDLC phases.<br>

# why cost of maintenance go high?

## Answer: <br>

## Real-life factors that increase maintenance cost:

- Software usually works well for about 10 to 15 years.
- Old software, made for slow computers with less memory and storage, can’t compete with new, modern software.
- As technology gets better, fixing and maintaining old software becomes more expensive.
- Most maintenance engineers are new and use trial and error to solve problems.
- Making changes can often damage the original design of the software, making future changes harder.
- Many changes are not written down, which can cause problems later.

## Software-related factors that increase maintenance cost:

- The structure of the software.
- The programming language used.
- Dependence on other external systems.
- The skill and availability of the staff.<br>


# Maintenance Activities

IEEE provides a framework for sequential maintenance process activities. It can be used in iterative manner and can be extended so that customized items and processes can be included.

## These activities go hand-in-hand with each of the following phase:

- **Finding the Problem (Identification & Tracing)** – We figure out what needs to be fixed or updated in the software. Users or the system might report issues through error messages. We also decide what type of maintenance is needed.

- **Checking the Change (Analysis**) – We check how the change will affect the system, including its safety and security. If the change is too big or risky, we look for other solutions. We also estimate the cost and time needed.

- **Planning the Fix (Design)** – We design the new parts of the software based on the problems we found. We create test plans to make sure everything will work well.

- **Making the Fix (Implementation)** – The programmers code the new parts and test them as they go.

- **Testing the Whole System (System Testing)** – We test the new parts with the old system to make sure everything works well together. The entire system is tested afterward.

- **User Testing (Acceptance Testing)** – The users try the system to make sure it works for them. Any problems they find are fixed or saved for future updates.

- **Installing the Update (Delivery)** – After the users approve, we install the updated system. This can be a small update or a full new installation. Final testing is done, and training is given if needed.

- **Managing Updates (Maintenance Management)**– We use tools to keep track of different versions and updates of the software, including patches and fixes.
